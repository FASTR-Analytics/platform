# PROTOCOL — App: Writing a Worker Routine

> connections are S2's `SYSTEM_02_persistence.md`.

Heavy/blocking work (R execution, CSV staging, bulk integration, DHIS2 import
runs) runs in a Deno Web Worker, never on the request thread. Every routine
follows the same lifecycle: spawn through the generic factory, the `"READY"`
handshake, a guarded `run()`, dedicated DB connections, a tracked slot, and
host-owned termination.

```text
host (main thread)                               worker (separate context)
─────────────────                                ─────────────────────────

  └ instantiateWorker("./worker.ts",
      import.meta.url, payload)
      new Worker(url, {type:"module"})  ───────► module loads
      worker.onmessage = READY handler           self.onmessage = run(e.data).catch(reportError)
      worker "error" listener: preventDefault,
        record error completion, terminate
                                        ◄──────── self.postMessage("READY")
      on "READY" → worker.postMessage(payload) ─► run(payload)   (alreadyRunning guard)
                                                    create dedicated DB connection(s)
                                                    …do the work…
                                                    report back (see below)
                                                    .end() every connection
      host terminates the worker on its
      terminal signal (COMPLETED / error /
      task_ended → removeRunningModule)
```

## The recipe

### 1. Create the folder pair

Each routine is a folder under `server/worker_routines/` with two files:

- `instantiate_worker.ts` — exports
  `instantiate<Name>Worker(payload):
  Worker`, a one-liner over the generic
  factory:

  ```ts
  export function instantiateWorker<T>(
    workerPath: string,
    callerUrl: string,
    data: T,
  ): Worker {
    const worker = new Worker(new URL(workerPath, callerUrl).href, {
      type: "module",
    });
    worker.onmessage = (e) => {
      if (e.data === "READY") worker.postMessage(data);
    };
    return worker;
  }
  ```

  (`server/worker_routines/instantiate_worker_generic.ts`.) Never `new
  Worker`
  directly and post immediately — the host must not post the payload until the
  worker says it's listening, or the post races module load.

- `worker.ts` — the worker entry point, opening with the standard preamble
  (currently hand-copied into all six routines — the shared `runWorker()`
  wrapper is PLAN_ENFORCEMENT item 8):

  ```ts
  (self as unknown as Worker).onmessage = (e) => {
    run(e.data).catch((error) => {
      console.error("Worker error:", error);
      self.reportError(error);   // surfaces to the host's "error" listener,
    });                          // which records the error and terminates us
  };
  (self as unknown as Worker).postMessage("READY");   // tell host we're listening

  let alreadyRunning = false;
  async function run(payload) {
    if (alreadyRunning) { self.close(); return; }      // re-entrancy guard
    alreadyRunning = true;
    …
  }
  ```

Extra files are fine when they earn their place: `run_module/` has
`run_module_iterator.ts` (the R streaming generator) and `container_name.ts`;
`import_hmis_data_dhis2/` has `dispatch.ts` (pure dispatcher logic importable
outside a worker context) and `scheduler.ts` (the 60 s scheduled-import tick).

### 2. Never `self.close()` in a worker

The host owns termination. Two empirically verified failure modes: a
`BroadcastChannel` message posted immediately before `self.close()` is silently
lost, and a `self.close()` in a `finally` runs before the rethrown error reaches
the preamble's `reportError`, so the host's `error` listener never fires and the
tracker slot is stranded. The only exception is the `alreadyRunning` re-entrancy
guard (nothing is pending there). Note the two report-back transports differ
here: worker→host `postMessage("COMPLETED")` survives host-side
terminate-on-receipt; a `BroadcastChannel` post immediately before a close is
lost. Don't reason from one to the other.

### 3. Attach the spawn-site listeners

**Every spawn site attaches an `error` listener with `e.preventDefault()`** —
without it, `reportError` propagates as an unhandled rejection and exits the
whole server process (verified on Deno 2.5.3 and 2.6.4). The listener records
the error completion, clears the tracker, and terminates the worker. Spawn sites
today: `task_management/trigger_runnable_tasks.ts` (module runs),
`db/instance/dataset_{hmis,hfa}.ts` (CSV staging/integration), and
`db/instance/dataset_hmis_import_runs.ts` (`spawnRunWorker`, DHIS2 import runs).
The dataset shape:

```ts
setWorker("hmis", worker); // per-family worker slot
worker.addEventListener("error", async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // don't crash the server
  await mainDb`UPDATE …upload_attempts SET status_type='error', status=…`;
  clearWorker("hmis", worker); // compare-and-delete
  worker.terminate(); // host owns termination
});
worker.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  if (e.data === "COMPLETED") {
    clearWorker("hmis", worker);
    worker.terminate(); // else the isolate leaks
  }
});
```

### 4. Dedicated DB connections, ended on every exit path

Workers must not use the request connection cache (it isn't shared across worker
contexts). Create dedicated pools via the worker factories
(`server/db/postgres/worker_connections.ts`, uncached, `prepare: false`):
`createWorkerReadConnection(id)` for read work,
`createBulkImportConnection("main")` for bulk staging/integration inserts.
**Every exit path must `.end()` them** — a `finally` holding only `.end()` calls
is fine (connection teardown only — never `self.close()` there). On a crash path
the host's terminate drops whatever the worker didn't end — acceptable, since
the isolate dies with its sockets.

### 5. Pick the report-back mechanism

- **(A) `task_ended` broadcast** — when completion should chain dependent work.
  The module worker posts an `EndingTaskData`
  (`{ projectId, moduleId, runToken, successOrError }`) to
  `BroadcastChannel("task_ended")`; a decoupled listener in
  `set_module_clean.ts` flips the DB row, clears the map entry, terminates, and
  re-triggers dependents. Crashes reach the same handler via the spawn site's
  `error` listener with `successOrError: "error"` — the worker's catch does
  `reportError` only, no broadcast. S8 owns these semantics.
- **(B) `postMessage("COMPLETED")` + status row** — a single tracked job the
  caller awaits. The worker writes progress/terminal state into its run/ attempt
  row (`status` JSON + denormalized `status_type` enum) for client polling, and
  finishes with `self.postMessage("COMPLETED")`; the caller-attached listeners
  clear the tracker and terminate.

The consumers are not interchangeable: dataset clients poll the `status_type`
enum; module clients react to `module_dirty_state`/`r_script` SSE. Wire the
matching one.

### 6. Register a tracker, and clear it on every terminal path

- **`worker_store.ts`** — at most one live worker per import family:
  `Map<WorkerKey, Worker>` with `WorkerKey = "hmis" | "hfa" | "hmis_dhis2_run"`
  (extend the union when adding a family), `setWorker` / `getWorker` /
  `clearWorker`. `clearWorker` is compare-and-delete (deletes only if the stored
  worker IS this worker), so a stale worker's late error/COMPLETED event cannot
  clobber a successor under the same key. The caller checks `getWorker(key)`
  before starting and refuses if one is in flight.
- **The running-tasks map** (module runs) — keyed `projectId` + `moduleId` with
  a per-run `runToken`; claim → attach → guaranteed
  `removeRunningModule`/`releaseClaimedModule`. Owned by S8 — new module-run
  completion paths go through `handleModuleTaskEnded`, nothing else.

An unterminated completed worker leaks its isolate and threads for the life of
the process; a worker that dies without clearing its tracker blocks future work.

## The routine inventory

| Folder                   | Payload                                   | Report-back                                              | Tracker                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `run_module`             | `{ projectId, moduleId, runToken }`       | `task_ended` broadcast (success) / `reportError` (crash) | running-tasks map                 |
| `stage_hmis_data_csv`    | `{ rawDUA }`                              | `postMessage("COMPLETED")` + status row                  | `worker_store` (`hmis`)           |
| `import_hmis_data_dhis2` | `{ runId, credentialsSource, selection }` | `postMessage("COMPLETED")` + run row + ledger            | `worker_store` (`hmis_dhis2_run`) |
| `stage_hfa_data_csv`     | `{ rawDUA }`                              | `postMessage("COMPLETED")` + status row                  | `worker_store` (`hfa`)            |
| `integrate_hmis_data`    | `{ rawDUA }`                              | `postMessage("COMPLETED")` + status row                  | `worker_store` (`hmis`)           |
| `integrate_hfa_data`     | `{ rawDUA }`                              | `postMessage("COMPLETED")` + status row                  | `worker_store` (`hfa`)            |

## Gotchas

- **READY is load-bearing.** A worker that does work before posting READY may
  miss its payload; one that posts READY late races the host.
- **`alreadyRunning` guards re-delivery.** If the host posts twice, the second
  `run` self-closes. Don't rely on one worker handling multiple payloads.
- **Don't diverge the preamble.** It's copy-pasted six times; subtle drift
  (READY string, error semantics) is a latent bug. Today only the
  `console.error` prefix varies — keep it that way until item 8 factors it.

## Checklist

- [ ] `server/worker_routines/<name>/instantiate_worker.ts` (factory over
      `instantiateWorker`) + `worker.ts` (standard preamble + `run`; no
      `self.close()` except the `alreadyRunning` guard)
- [ ] Spawn site attaches `error` (with `e.preventDefault()`) + `message`
      listeners — mandatory for both report-back models
- [ ] `createWorkerReadConnection` / `createBulkImportConnection`; `.end()` on
      every exit path (a `finally` may hold `.end()` calls only)
- [ ] Report-back matches the need: `task_ended` (chains work) or
      `postMessage("COMPLETED")` + status row (tracked job)
- [ ] Tracker registered and cleared + worker terminated on every terminal path
